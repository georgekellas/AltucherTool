# AltucherTool
This simple tool was named after an idea generating exercise loved by James Altucher. It allows one to randomize options and generate conversation prompts for brainstorming.

# This device is an "idea slot machine" used for facilitating thought and brainstorming by randomizing prompts. It includes 3 text boxes (1 per category) and a larger box (1 per category) for your ideas relating to the category.
